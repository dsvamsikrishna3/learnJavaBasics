#Encapsulation—
Encapsulating the data and behavior into a single object is of primary importance in OO development. A single object contains both its data and behaviors and can hide what it wants from other objects.
#Inheritance—
A class can inherit from another class and take advantage of the attributes and methods defined by the superclass.
#Polymorphism—
Polymorphism means that similar objects can respond to the same message in different ways. For example, you might have a system with many shapes. However, a circle, a square, and a star are each drawn differently. Using polymorphism, you can send each of these shapes the same message (for example, Draw), and each shape is responsible for drawing itself.
#Composition—
Composition means that an object is built from other objects.
